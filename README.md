# brainyMcBrain

Central repository for Giel's `CLAUDE.md` brain — a modular instruction system for AI assistants across all projects, hobbies, and tasks.

## How It Works

One master `CLAUDE.md` references **skills** (universal rules), **languages** (per-language conventions), **domains** (subject-matter expertise), and **projects** (project-specific context). Claude Code loads all referenced files automatically via `@`-imports.

New knowledge gets added to the **Inbox** in `CLAUDE.md`, categorised, then promoted to the correct module.

## Tracked Projects

| Project | Languages | Domains | Source |
|---------|-----------|---------|--------|
| 40Jarigen | web-pwa | event-planning, obsidian-vault, iot-hardware | `GielW/40Jarigen` |
| DPO-Dashboard | python | obsidian-vault, belgian-legal | `GielW/DPO-Dashboard` |
| ilumenTool | dart-flutter | iot-hardware | `RdFutech/ilumenTool` |

## How Knowledge Flows

brainyMcBrain is the **source of truth**. The workflow:

1. You're working in a project (e.g., ilumenTool)
2. You establish a new convention or fix a recurring pattern
3. **Claude flags it**: _"This looks like reusable knowledge. It should be added to brainyMcBrain."_
4. Switch to brainyMcBrain → add to the **Inbox** in `CLAUDE.md`
5. Categorise it (use the Category Quick Reference table)
6. Promote it to the correct skill/language/domain file
7. Delete from inbox

This replaces the old approach of syncing monolithic claude.md files back and forth.

## Brain Compiler

The compiler assembles the modular brain into **project-specific standalone claude.md files**. Each compiled file includes only the skills, languages, and domains that project needs — all inlined into one self-contained file.

```bash
python3 tools/compile-brain.py all              # Compile all projects → compiled/
python3 tools/compile-brain.py ilumenTool       # Compile one project
python3 tools/compile-brain.py all --dry-run    # Preview without writing
```

Output goes to `compiled/<project>/<claude.md>`. These compiled files are what gets pushed to project repos via the sync workflow.

## Brain Linter

Validates internal consistency — catches broken imports, orphan files, missing frontmatter, and config drift.

```bash
python3 tools/validate-brain.py                 # Run all checks
```

Runs automatically on every push to `main` via the **Validate Brain** GitHub Action.

## Archive Sync (backup role)

The `sync.sh` script serves a **backup/reference** role — it snapshots the original project claude.md files into `projects-archive/`.

```bash
./sync.sh status           # Check if project originals have drifted from archive
./sync.sh pull             # Snapshot latest originals into archive
./sync.sh push             # Restore archive copies back to project repos (rare)
./sync.sh discover         # Scan PC for new repos with claude.md files
./sync.sh add <name> <path>  # Track a new project's original file
./sync.sh update-external  # Update external skill repos (submodules)
./sync.sh auto             # Pull + update externals + commit + push (cron daily)
```

### GitHub Action — Sync claude.md to Projects

Compiles the brain and pushes the result to project repos. Runs in two modes:

- **Automatic:** Triggers after the **Validate Brain** workflow succeeds on `main`. When you push changes to skills, languages, domains, projects, or CLAUDE.md, the brain is validated first — if validation passes, all project repos receive updated compiled files automatically.
- **Manual:** Go to **Actions → Sync claude.md to projects**, click **Run workflow**, and pick a specific project or `all`.

**Setup:** Add a Personal Access Token as `BRAIN_SYNC_PAT` in this repo's secrets. The token needs `repo` scope (or fine-grained: Contents read/write) for the target repos.

### GitHub Action — Validate Brain

Runs automatically on every push to `main` that touches skill, language, domain, project files, or CLAUDE.md. Also runs on pull requests.

### GitHub Action — Sync TODOs to GitHub Issues

A manual Action that parses TODO/progress markdown files from each project and creates/updates/closes GitHub Issues to match.

1. Go to **Actions → Sync TODOs to GitHub Issues**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Pick a project or `all`, and optionally enable **Dry run** to preview
4. The action creates issues with labels (`phase:P1-core`, `priority:high`, `synced-from-todo`) and closes issues whose TODO status is "Done"

**Supported formats:**
- ilumenTool-style: `| # | Phase | Status | Priority | Description |`
- DPO-Dashboard-style: `| Task | ✅ Done / ⬜ Not started | Date |`

The parser script lives at `tools/todo-to-issues.py` and can also be run locally:
```bash
python3 tools/todo-to-issues.py --dry-run          # Preview all projects
python3 tools/todo-to-issues.py ilumenTool          # Sync one project
python3 tools/todo-to-issues.py all                 # Sync all projects
```

**Setup:** Same `BRAIN_SYNC_PAT` secret — needs `repo` scope + Issues write permission.

## External Skills

The [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) repo is tracked as a git submodule in `skills-external/anthropic/`. It's updated automatically during the daily cron sync.

To update manually:
```bash
./sync.sh update-external
```

To use an external skill in a project, reference it via:
```
@skills-external/anthropic/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

Available skills: algorithmic-art, brand-guidelines, canvas-design, claude-api, doc-coauthoring, docx, frontend-design, internal-comms, mcp-builder, pdf, pptx, skill-creator, slack-gif-creator, theme-factory, web-artifacts-builder, webapp-testing, xlsx

## Adding a New Project

1. `./sync.sh add ProjectName /path/to/ProjectName/CLAUDE.md` — tracks the original for archive
2. Create `projects/ProjectName.md` — slim project-specific context referencing skills/languages/domains
3. Update this README
4. Optionally add a new language/domain file if the project needs one not yet covered
